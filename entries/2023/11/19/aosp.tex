\subsection{Building AOSP HAL}
\label{task:20231119_aosp_hal}

\subsubsection*{Implementing the HAL}

Device driver and its API are usually provided by a third-party hardware provider. Shim code include \path{.h} files for one or more device drivers.

New devices can communicate with the processor via USB which is popular. Even without driver, the device can be accessed with generic USB commands. 
\textit{libusb}\footnote{\url{https://libusb.info}} is a portable, user-mode, and USB-version agnostic library for using USB devices, and supports Android. If the device has a driver, it is likely to be a specialization of the USB command.
